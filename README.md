# Weather_Telegram_bot

Telegram bot code for weather forecasts in Spain

This Telegram bot has been created with the aim of providing accurate weather forecast information within Spain.

It is intended to provide a similar functionality as weatherman_bot, but with improved accuracy thanks to national weather forecast sources: Aemet and eltiempo.es (Update: eltiempo.es has updated the website, so parsing their data is no longer working. Since that part of the code is messy and not so easy to develop, I've commented it out)

This bot has been created using bot examples and documentation from python-telegram-bot.

For the functionality, the bot is using a name's and code's database from apimet. I have tweaked it a bit so that it better fits my intended usage, but the database as such, and the code to create it have been quite helpful to me

I hereby acknokledge their contribution to this project

This is my first project on github, so sugestions and comments are definetively wellcomed

To run this bot, replace 'TOKEN' with you own token code, and run it in your machine I itend to run it in my own rpi, but this might take a while...
